### Overview
A login program created using react, that uses the hook useReducer to store the state and values.

## What I learned
- Use reducer returns an array of two values, which can be destruc where one is the current value of state, and a dispatch function(action)
- Switch statements used inside usereducer as its faster and alternatiev would be if else statements
- useReducer makes the state an object, where you define your values
- To actually call our switch statements, we do dispatch{type: ....}
